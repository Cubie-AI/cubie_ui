# Hello World

This is our first blog post using MDX!

## What is MDX?

MDX allows us to use JSX in our markdown content. This means we can import and use React components right in our markdown files.

Here's an example of what we can do:

- Write markdown as usual
- Import and use React components
- Use JavaScript expressions

Pretty cool, right?
